# YATÎ›
Yet another todo application! this one is implemented in Racket and aimed towards quick cli-usage. I'm using `dialog` and `whiptail` for the user interface which allows for a smooth cross-platform / non-gui-required experience :)

### Roadmap
- [x] spawn dialog/whiptail and let the childprocess capture stdin and stdout of the parent process (thanks @cky !).
- [x] parse Racket list to dialog/whiptail arguments (called it argify :smile_cat:)
- [x] read/write todo list in data mode
- [x] parse dialog/whiptail's return value to actual changes
- [x] stack/chain dialogs for adding a new todo
- [x] Create
- [x] Read
- [ ] Update
- [x] Delete
- [ ] decouple dialog module so that unsorted-todo-list -> unsorted-todo-list with changes. Sorting and indexing gets abstracted within dialog module.
- [ ] menu for CRUD on todos
- [ ] connect with google todo api

### FAQ
_where are my todos saved?_

Yata uses `(build-path (find-system-path 'home-dir) ".racket" "yata" "todos.rkt"))` which will eventually end up saving them somewhere like `/home/phil/.racket/yata/todos.rkt` if you're on linux

### Known issues
dialog/whiptail's `--checklist` returns an empty string if the dialog gets cancelled but also if no todos are checked. If all Todos are unchecked but one and this only checked one gets unchecked the new state won't be saved because it's more likely to be a cancelled dialog.
