# YATÎ›
Yet another todo application! this one is implemented in Racket and aimed towards quick cli-usage. I'm using `dialog` and `whiptail` for the user interface which allows for a smooth cross-platform / non-gui-required experience :)

### Roadmap
- [x] spawn dialog/whiptail and let the childprocess capture stdin and stdout of the parent process (thanks @cky !).
- [x] parse Racket list to dialog/whiptail arguments (called it argify :smile_cat:)
- [x] read/write todo list in data mode
- [ ] parse dialog/whiptail's return value to actual changes
- [ ] stack/chain dialogs for adding a new todo
- [ ] menu for CRUD on todos
